Not for Operating purposes, but instead to explain myself.

A3, the main file has a single run of the attempted program, then sets the time manually to well after the time limit, for the express purpose of ending the program.
Without this, the program runs indefinitely.

The issue, i believe is that a Stage without a widget thinks it is 'working' and thus assumes it's finish time, or job completion time is incorrect. 
then, rightfully tries to reset it's completion time, to which it does, back to 0, and then loops. infinitely. at time:0.

attempting to figure out what the ACTUAl root of the problem is presents to be impossible for my feeble brain and as such, i cannot find the problem

i have, on 4 seperate occaisions now, sat at my computer trying to figure out where the problem comes from for 40 mins a piece to no avail.

There is now not enough time for me to completely restart writing the whole program, so hopefully you can forgive the state the program is in.

This is what i have, and hopefully this suffices for at least *some* marks.

I apologise for the inconvenience.
